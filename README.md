## Research Focus
This code repository contains image processing related codes based on OpenCV (C++)

### Direction 1: underwater image enhancement based on traditional digital image processing algorithm
We focus on image enhancement and reconstruction technology based on OpenCV, and will finally apply our algorithm to underwater image enhancement and reconstruction. We will first study the traditional image enhancement methods, such as Gamma transform, histogram equalization, white balance, dark channel priori, image fusion based on Laplacian pyramid, etc. 

### Direction 2: underwater image enhancement based on deep learning 
At the same time, we will also study the underwater image processing based on deep learning, such as CNN image reconstruction (SRCNN, FSRCNN, SRGAN, etc.), but the difficulty of using deep learning is how to obtain pairs of data and labels.It's mainly because the underwater high-definition images are difficult to obtain. However, the advantages of deep learning is when the networks finish the training, it will be quite easy for us to use.

How to get higher quality underwater image in the improved algorithm is our ultimate research goal.
